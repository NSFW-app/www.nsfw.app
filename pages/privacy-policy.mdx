- For Business transfers: we may share or transfer your personal
  information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger,

## 11\. Retention of your Information

We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for
the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your
Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal
obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to
comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes and enforce our legal
agreements and policies.

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as we consider it
necessary to:

- Enable you to use our Websites and provide our Websites to you,
  including maintaining your Profile.

- Comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of
  your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.

- Conduct our business and for our legitimate business interests, such
  as establishing, exercising or defending legal claims, chargeback
  prevention, fraud detection and prevention, hindering any other illegal
  activity on our site, and enhancing safety. For example, if we close or
  suspend your Profile for fraud or illegal activities, we may retain
  certain information about you to prevent you from opening a new Profile
  in the future. Such information shall also be kept available in case of
  ongoing judicial proceedings/and or investigations. As part of our fraud
  detection and prevention process, we also blacklist all former usernames
  for a certain time. Therefore, a former username cannot be used for a
  new registration.

  malicious loss and destruction. Residual copies of your personal
  information may not be removed from our backup systems for a very
  limited time (usually 30 days). Some copies of your information (e.g.,
  log records) may also remain in our database, but are disassociated from

information represents your agreement to that transfer. We will take all
the steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated
securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and we will make no
transfer of your Personal Data to an organisation or a country unless
there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your
data and other personal information.

alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored

## 20\. Risk of using digital assets.

Please note that all transactions involving Digital Assets involve
certain risks. In this regard, once submitted to a blockchain network,
such a transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending
sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the blockchain network. A
transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Any Digital
Assets transfers, to and from external wallet addresses, that are in a
pending state will be designated accordingly, and the relevant Digital
Asset will not be included in your Digital Asset Wallet or be available
to conduct transactions.

The risk of loss in holding Digital Assets can be substantial. You
should therefore carefully

consider whether holding Digital Assets is suitable for you in light of
your financial situation.

In considering whether to hold Digital Assets, you should be aware that
the price or value of Digital Assets can change rapidly, decrease, and
potentially even fall to zero. Past performance is not an indicator of
future performance. If you use any nsfw.app Services which allow you
and/or third parties to access and hold Digital Asset private keys, you
acknowledge that we are not responsible for safeguarding such keys and
that we are not responsible for any loss of Digital Assets resulting
from theft, loss, or mishandling of Digital Asset private keys outside
our control.

We are not responsible for the market of Digital Assets, and we make no
representations or

warranties concerning the real or perceived value of Digital Assets as
denominated in any quoted currency. You understand and acknowledge that
the value of Digital Assets can be volatile, and you agree that we are
not in any way responsible or liable for any losses you may incur by
holding or trading Digital Assets, even if the nsfw.app App Services
were delayed, suspended, or interrupted for any reason.

We do not provide investment advice tax advice, financial advice or any
other professional

advice and any content on the nsfw.app and Site should not be considered
as such

advice such as a substitute for tailored investment, financial advice.

## 21\. Underage Content and Children's Privacy

Our Website does not address anyone under the age of 18. No one under
the age of 18 may provide any personal information to or on the Website.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are
aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact

use or provide any information on this Website or through any of its
features, do not register on the Website, do not make any purchases

us.

We use age verification services, where required to prove age, as well
as require Content Creators to provide a copy of their current
government issued photo identification in order to ensure our users and
Content Creators' compliance with applicable legislation.

Anyone under the age of 18 is not legally permitted on the Website for
any reason, and if we find you on this Site, we will report you to law
enforcement as noted above. We will not reactivate you for any reason
ever. We also recommend that Users implement parental control
protections, such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services,
which reduce the opportunity for minors' access to Site.

If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from anyone
under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent, we take
steps to remove that information from our servers.
